This is a website I built for some friends for thier business. It was a freebie.

Its essentially a Laravel application, but because it was free, and I was lazy, I offloaded all of the CRUD to an admin interface library.

If you know about running a Laravel environment locally then you should be good to go - the migrations and seeds should have everything you need. The site was itself a migration of a much older plain HTML site, so it made sense to include the imports and raw CSV-converted data for demonstration purposes.
